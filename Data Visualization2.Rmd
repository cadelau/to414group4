#Exploring probaility of purchase across different variables:

library(ggplot2)

barplot(tapply(shopping$Revenue, shopping$MonthN, mean), col="#203864", main="Probability of Purchase by Month",
 ylab="Probability of Purchase", names.arg=c("Feb.", "Mar.", "May", "Jun.", "July", "Aug.", "Sept.", "Oct.", "Nov.", "Dec."))

#Customers significantly more likely to purchase between months of July and November

barplot(tapply(shopping$Revenue, shopping$Weekend, mean), ylim = c(0,.20), col="#203864", names.arg=c("Weekday", "Weekend"), main="Probability of Purchase on Weekends",
 ylab="Probability of Purchase")
#Customers marginally more likely to purchase on weekends

barplot(tapply(shopping$Revenue, shopping$SpecialDay, mean), col="#203864", main="Probability of Purchase on \"Special Days\"", ylab= "Probability of Purchase", xlab = "Normalized distance from \"Special Day\" (max 1 week)")

#Seems to suggest a counterintuitive trend towards buying around special days
